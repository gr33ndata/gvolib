Global Voices Online Library 
=============================

Global Voices Online is mainly a volunteer community of more than 1200 writers, analysts, online media experts and translators who try to report what is going in on citizen media since 2005. The website is built using WordPress, and this tool tried to extract meaningful data from the different RSS feeds it provides for academics and other hackers to use in their researches and analysis. 

There are two main components of this project:

#. Python library that you can reuse in your code (gvolib) 
#. CLI tool built on top of gvolib (gvo.py)


Installation
-------------

You sure need to have Python installed on your computer.

`Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ is needed for the CLI tool but not for the library itself.
